# Predicting Grades Using Linear Regression

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of Linear Regression to predict grades of students based on their:
* Intelligence level
* Hours of study
* Special abilities
* Material abilities

Data set is obtained from this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/L75gixic1G9X6nbV7). You can also participate in the survey and contribute to the data set.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the `main.py` file using `python main.py`

## Jupiter Notebook
The notebook `Predicting Grades.ipynb` contains the same code as the `main.py` file. It can be used to run the code in a Jupiter Notebook environment.
